# Coursera: Algorithmic Toolbox

This repository contains my work for the course [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. The solutions are implemented in Java.

**Disclaimer:** The below solutions are **for reference only**. Please design and implement your own algorithms to pass the course.

### Week 1 - Programming Challenges

- Solution for problem [Maximum Pairwise Product](https://github.com/prog-lessons/courses/blob/master/Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox/week1_programming_challenges/MaxPairwiseProduct.java)

### Week 2- Algorithmic Warm-up

- Solution for problem [Fibonacci Number](https://github.com/prog-lessons/courses/blob/master/Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox/week2_algorithmic_warmup/Fibonacci.java)
- Solution for problem [Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number](https://github.com/prog-lessons/courses/blob/master/Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox/week2_algorithmic_warmup/FibonacciLastDigit.java)
- Solution for problem [Greatest Common Divisor](https://github.com/prog-lessons/courses/blob/master/Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox/week2_algorithmic_warmup/GCD.java)
- Solution for problem [Least Common Multiple](https://github.com/prog-lessons/courses/blob/master/Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox/week2_algorithmic_warmup/LCM.java)
